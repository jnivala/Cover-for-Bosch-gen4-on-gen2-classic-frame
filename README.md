# Motor cover for an ebike with a Bosch gen4 motor retrofitted to a gen2 classic frame
Cobee sells adapters that allow you install a Bosch gen4 motor to an ebike that was factory fitted with a gen4 Performance Line or Performance Line CX motor (see here: https://www.emtbforums.com/threads/anyone-ever-replaced-a-cx-gen-2-for-the-new-gen-4.20513/).

The adapters are bolt-on and work well. The original motor cover is not compatible with the retrofitted gen4 motor. This repository contains 3D model files that can be used to print a cover for a bike that originally came with classic (egg shaped) Bosch cover.
