# Motor cover for an ebike with a Bosch gen4 motor retrofitted to a gen2 classic frame
[Cobee](https://www.emtbforums.com/members/cobee.29868/) sells adapters that allow you to install a Bosch gen4 motor to an ebike that was factory fitted with a gen2 Performance Line or Performance Line CX motor (see here: https://www.emtbforums.com/threads/anyone-ever-replaced-a-cx-gen-2-for-the-new-gen-4.20513/).

The adapters are bolt-on and work well. The original motor cover is not compatible with the retrofitted gen4 motor. This repository tries to solve the "cover issue" for those bikes that had the standard Bosch egg-shaped cover. It looks like this:

Covers for gen4:

The right side of the engine was too complicated to deal with so I covered it completely. That's why the left side has a downward hole in the front for airflow. On the right side there is a slot to allow easier installation of spider bolts. Left and right side are joined with four screws. Upper two are standard Bosch gen2 case screws. Lower two are M5 (hex screw with round head). In the bottom there are holes to allow water to exit like in standard gen2 cover.

After printing I made one modification which I haven't tested. It is shown in the following picture. There was a gap between the case and motor. In case it is too tight now, you need to cut slightly or modify the model. See:

Repository includes STL files and the Autodesk Fusion 360 design file. Fusion 360 is free for personal use. The project was my first with Fusion 360. The project timeline could be cleaner, constraints used rather than fixing items, etc.
