# Motor cover for an ebike with a Bosch gen4 motor retrofitted to a gen2 classic frame
Cobee sells adapters that allow you install a Bosch gen4 motor to an ebike that was factory fitted with a gen4 Performance Line or Performance Line CX motor (see here: https://www.emtbforums.com/threads/anyone-ever-replaced-a-cx-gen-2-for-the-new-gen-4.20513/).

The adapters are bolt-on and work well. The original motor cover is not compatible with the retrofitted gen4 motor. This repository tries to solve the "cover issue" for those bikes that had the standard Bosch egg-shaped cover. It looks like this:
